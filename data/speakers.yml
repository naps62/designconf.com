  bio: "Kyle leads a design team of about 30 designers at thoughtbot. He enjoys working through complex problems and coming up with simple solutions using tools such as research, design thinking, design sprints, and jobs-to-be-done to help him best understand what a product is trying to solve. He loves shipping early and iterating."
  abstract: "Should designers code? Should they generalize or specialize? As a community we constantly reiterate these same arguments. What makes a great team is when each member’s lines of responsibility blurs into that of others. At thoughtbot, designers have a wide range of responsibilities from business strategy to graphic design, to implementing a great user expense in the app. Kyle discusses why this has been successful for their teams and how designer and developer lines blur together at thoughtbot."

  talk: "On CSS accessibility and drinking tea"
  abstract: "When the web was new, design and structure were all mixed up together. Eventually we realised this was very messy, so we invented CSS and separated design from HTML. Everyone felt much better after this, and went and had a cup of tea. But while everyone was drinking tea (and not really paying attention), the line between design and structure began to get messy again. Things like the before/after pseudo-selectors made it possible for CSS to directly change content, and features like FlexBox push the concept of separation to breaking point. Conversely, CSS is being used as a development tool for visualising semantic information like role and state, when added to an interface using ARIA. In this talk Léonie will look at the changing relationship between design and structure, and what it means for accessibility mechanics in the browser. She will share CSS code examples and design patterns for solving common accessibility problems, so everyone can go and have another nice cup of tea."

  talk: "Proper etiquette for the advancement of design"
  abstract: "Designing at your desk with Photoshop or HTML and CSS is easy, but getting your bosses and clients to give your work their stamp of approval is often quite a feat. In this presentation, Dan will share some stories of tools, methodologies, and non-traditional deliverables that can help you get the buy-in you need. Follow along to learn how to make everyone you work with say "please" and "thank you!""

  talk: "Innovative SVG animations"
  abstract: "There are a ton of amazing benefits of working with SVGs: great support, resolution-independant, and scalable images that can reduce the needs for multiple HTTP requests. SVGs offer a navigable DOM that shine for animation and accessibility purposes. But SVGs are capable of so much more. In this session, we’ll manipulate vectors with a myriad of creative techniques, ranging from the practical, such as data visualization with D3 and React, to the delicate, such as imitating candle smoke with morphing path data. We'll go over how to increase engagement and performance in User Experience with examples and case studies. We’ll use SVGs as a window with clipPath, push the boundaries of the CPU with filters, and even combine techniques to create otherworldly effects."

  talk: "The future of Web Design"
  abstract: "Web design is stuck in the past. Currently, a reliance on coding frameworks that inhibits creativity, or print software not built to handle today's responsive web have created a huge gap in what web designers of the future need. In this talk, we look through the progression of the web from the lens of an outsider, and peer into the future of what could be a shift in the way designers build for this ever changing medium."

  talk: "Illustration as a means of identifying with a product"
  abstract: "When done properly, illustration invokes emotion. With the world saturated in interfaces that are dissolving into the background, emotion is taking the front seat. Illustration and emotion add a personal touch, and users feel more comfortable, even at ease, with groundbreaking technology. Illustration is a great tool for communicating patterns to a user and helping them reach their goal or finishing their task. Illustration is used in ideation, conception and the final design of the product. Enhancing drawings and interfaces with animation doesn't only render the message clearer, but also emotionally charged - and therefore memorable. After all, a picture is worth a thousand words, right? While it may be argued that illustration is not a must-have, but a nice-to-have at best, it’s a feature that breathes personality and vibrance into a product. Illustration paves the way from an easy-to-use product to a user at ease."
